0.19.1 - 2008-10-12
-------------------
- Re-enable building when OpenSSL built without EC support, by Miloslav Trmac
- Remove shebang from Engine.py since it is not executable, by Miloslav Trmac

0.19 - 2008-10-05
-----------------
- OpenSSL OBJ_* functions wrapped by Pavel Shramov
- OpenSSL ENGINE interface wrapped, providing support for smart cards, by
  Martin Paljak and Pavel Shramov
- EVP.PKey.get_rsa() now returns RSA_pub, which fixes segmentation fault
  when trying to encrypt using public key from X509 certificate, by Ben Timby
- httpslib.ProxyHTTPSConnection now sends the required Host header,
  by Karl Grindley
- Use the proxied User-Agent value in CONNECT requests, by James Antill and
  Miloslav Trmac
- Fixed m2urllib.build_opener when optional handlers were in use,
  affected Python 2.5 and later, by Miloslav Trmac
- Reverted the incorrect GIL change done in 0.18 to m2.passphrase_callback,
  which caused a deadlock when called from mod_python for example. Thanks to
  Michal Kochel and Keith Jackson.
- SSL.Connection.accept() passed wrong certificate to postConnectionCheck
  callback
- httpslib.HTTPSConnection now raises ValueError for illegal keyword argument
- m2.pkey_write_pem[_no_cipher] changed to use the recommended (more secure)
  PEM_write_bio_PKCS8PrivateKey (used by PEM_write_bio_PrivateKey).
- X509.load_cert, load_cert_bio, load_cert_der_string, new_stack_from_der,
  load_request and load_crl now raise X509Error for invalid data. Previously
  some of these raised a string as an error, some did not raise but caused
  strange errors later, for example x509.verify() would return -1.
- Fixed SSL.Connection.get_socket_read_timeout and set_socket_read_timeout on
  64bit platforms by adding SSL.timeout.struct_size() and using it instead of
  hardcoded size for socket.getsockopt
- X509_Store.load_info now returns the value from the underlying
  m2.x509_store_load_locations call, and in case of error raises X509Error
- Fixed SMIME.verify to raise the correct PKCS7_Error (used to raise
  SMIME_Error) when verification fails with Python 2.6

0.18.2 - 2007-10-12
-------------------
- typedef Py_ssize_t was insufficiently guarded, now follows PEP 353. This
  prevented building on at least Red Hat Linux and Debian Linux (unstable).

0.18.1 - 2007-10-08
-------------------
- Redo build fix when OpenSSL configured without Elliptic Curves (EC), see
  also INSTALL file

0.18 - 2007-07-26
-----------------
- Added EVP.pbkdf2 to derive key from password
- X509_Store_Context.get1_chain added
- Added X509_Name.__iter__, __getitem__, get_entries_by_nid which allow
  iterating over all X509_Name_Entries or getting just all commonName entries,
  for example
- Added X509_Name_Entry.get_object, get_data, set_data
- Added back PKCS7.get0_signers (was removed in 0.16)
- X509_Extension.get_value accepts flag and indent parameters.
- support multiple dNSName fields in subjectAltName
- support multiple commonName fields for SSL peer hostname checking
- Checking for erroneous returns from more OpenSSL EVP_* functions, which
  means that certain things that used to fail silently will now raise an
  EVP.EVPError; affected m2 functions are: digest_final, cipher_init,
  cipher_update, cipher_final and sign_update. sign_final will now raise
  EVP.EVPError instead of SystemError as well.
- Fixed Pkey.verify_final to take a sign parameter
- If a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName is present in peer certificate,
  use only the dNSNames when checking peer certificate hostname, as specified
  by RFC 2818. If no dNSNames are present, use subject commonName.
- Fixed memory leaks in m2 functions ec_key_new_by_curve_name,
  pkey_get_modulus, ecdsa_verify, threading_init and
  X509.X509.verify, X509.X509_Stack (which manifested for example when
  calling X509.new_stack_from_der), SSL.Connection (which manifested with some
  connection errors or when connect was never called), twisted wrapper,
  SSL.Connection.makefile (in BIO.IOBuffer really)
- Fixed threading regressions introduced in 0.16,
  by Aaron Reizes and Keith Jackson
- Added SSL session caching support to HTTPSConnection, by Keith Jackson
- Added the ability to save and load DER formatted X509 certificates and
  certificate requests, by Keith Jackson
- m2xmlrpclib.py fixed to work with Python 2.5, by Miloslav Trmac
- 64-bit correctness fixes, by Miloslav Trmac
- Added X509_Name.as_hash, by Thomas Uram
- Moved --openssl option from general setup.py option to build_ext option,
  meaning you need to do: python setup.py build build_ext --openssl=/path,
  by Philip Kershaw
- Fixed build problem affecting certain systems where OpenSSL was built without
  EC support
- M2CRYPTO_TEST_SSL_SLEEP environment variable controls how long to sleep
  after starting the test SSL server. Default is 0.5, but 0.1 or even 0.05
  might work with modern computers. Makes tests finish significantly faster.

0.17 - 2006-12-20
-----------------
- setup.py has new test command to run unit tests (requires setuptools)
- Added m2urllib2, by James Bowes (python 2.4 and later, at least for now)
- Added CONNECT proxy for httpslib and m2urllib2, by James Bowes
- Added PKey.get_modulus, X509.get_fingerprint, X509_Name.as_der and
  m2.bn_to_hex, by Thomas Uram
- Prevent Connection.makefile from freeing bio redundantly, by Thomas Uram
- Added Err.peek_error_code, by Thomas Uram
- Fixed m2urllib.open_https to return the response headers, otherwise code
  that relied on that would break (for example msnlib-3.5), by Arno bakker
- Fixed twisted wrapper to work with >16kb BIO buffers, by Martin Paljak
- Added support for remaining ECs, by Larry Bugbee
- Fixed DSA.save_key and DSA_.save_pub_key, by Larry Bugbee
- SSL.Context.load_verify_locations raises ValueError if cafile and capath
  are both None
- Fixed X509.check_purpose() (was always raising exceptions)
- smime_read_pkcs7 was changed to automatically call BIO_set_mem_eof_return
  on memory BIOs because otherwise the read would fail with 
  "SMIME_Error: not enough data"
- X509.new_extension('subjectKeyIdentifier', 'hash') raises ValueError instead
  of crashing Python

0.16 - 2006-07-05
-----------------

  verification error that will be allowed when unknown CAs are allowed
- post connection checks in Connection.accept() and connect() fixed (these
  were broken in 0.15)
- Fixed EVP.Cipher to work with aes_* ciphers (used to crash Python).
  The actual problem was in m2.bytes_to_key.
- SMIME methods and functions raise correct exceptions
- Raise ValueError instead of AttributeError when a non-existing hash
  algorithm or SSL version is asked for
- ssl_ctx_set_tmp_(dh|rsa) now return value, and the rsa version calls
  the rsa function instead of the dh function
- digest_update and verify_update return type changed to int, which allows
  better error reporting; EVP.MessageDigest.update and
  EVP.PKey.verify_update likewise changed
- X509_Name and ASN1_String as_text (new for ASN1_String) take optional
  parameters to control formatting.
- Cipher_Stack, X509_Stack and X509_Extension_Stack are iterable
- EVP.MessageDigest now properly cleans up the underlying data when the object
  gets deleted
- It is now possible to set and get non-nid values to X509_Name (previously
  only set worked)
- SSL.Connection.set_client_CA_list_from_file now uses the actual implementd
  function instead of raising exception
- Multithreaded SSL no longer uses the SSL_set/get_app_data to set and
  restore thread state, but uses the standard PyGILState_STATE instead.
- m2urllib no longer outputs the HTTP headers (there was an erronous call
  to set_debuglevel(1))
- Removed RCS_id, RCS_ID and _RCS_id from Python files
- All known memory leaks fixed
- SWIG and compiler warning fixes
- More and better Epydoc formatted docstrings
- More than doubled the number of unit tests, also made many demos into tests

- Many cases where Python interpreter crashed have been fixed
- Improved thread safety of many callbacks
- And of course more of the OpenSSL API is covered, new docstrings and
  tests have been written
