<p> M2Crypto was created during the time of Python 1.5, which features
    a module httplib providing client-side HTTP functionality. M2Crypto sports
    a httpslib based on httplib.
    </p>

    <p>
    Beginning with version 2.0, Python's socket module provided
    (rudimentary) SSL support. Also in the same version, httplib was
    enhanced with class HTTPConnection, which is more sophisticated than
    the old class HTTP, and HTTPSConnection, which does HTTPS.
    </p>

    <p>
    Subsequently, M2Crypto.httpslib grew a compatible (but not identical)
    class HTTPSConnection. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The primary interface difference between the two HTTPSConnection
    classes is that M2Crypto's version accepts an M2Crypto.SSL.Context
    instance as a parameter, whereas Python 2.x's SSL support does not
    permit Pythonic control of the SSL context.
    </p>

    <p> Within the implementations, Python's
    <tt>HTTPSConnection</tt> employs a
    <tt>FakeSocket</tt> object, which collects all input from
    the SSL connection before returning it to the application as a
    <tt>StringIO</tt> buffer, whereas M2Crypto's
    <tt>HTTPSConnection</tt> uses a buffering
    <tt>M2Crypto.BIO.IOBuffer</tt> object that works over the
    underlying M2Crypto.SSL.Connection directly.  </p>

	<p>Since then M2Crypto has gained a Twisted wrapper that allows securing
	Twisted SSL connections with M2Crypto.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you read the book Network Security with OpenSSL by John Viega, Matt Messier and Pravir Chandra,
ISBN 059600270X.</p>	

<p>Using M2Crypto does not automatically make an SSL connection secure. There are various steps that need to be made
before we can make that claim. Let's see how a simple client can establish a secure connection:</p>

<pre>
ctx = SSL.Context()
ctx.set_verify(SSL.verify_peer | SSL.verify_fail_if_no_peer_cert, depth=9)
if ctx.load_verify_locations('ca.pem') != 1: raise Exception('No CA certs')
s = SSL.Connection(ctx)
s.connect(server_address)
# Normal protocol (for example HTTP) commands follow
</pre>

<p>The first line creates an SSL context. The defaults allow any SSL version (except SSL version 2 which has known
weaknesses) and sets the allowed ciphers to secure ones.</p>
	
<p>The second line tells M2Crypto to perform certificate validation. The flags shown above are typical for clients,
and requires the server to send a certificate. The depth parameter tells how long certificate chains are allowed -
9 is pretty common default, although probably too long in practice.</p>
	
<p>The third line loads the allowed root (certificate authority) certificates.</p>	

<p>The fourth line creates an SSL connection object with the secure context.</p>
	
<p>The fifth line connects to the server. During this time we perform the last security step: just after connection, but before
exchanging any data, we compare the commonName (or subjectAltName DNS field) field in the certificate the server returned to the 
server address we tried to connect to. This happens automatically with SSL.Connection and the Twisted wrapper class, and anything
that uses those. In all other cases you must do the check manually. It is recommended you call the SSL.Checker to do the actual check.</p>

<p>SSL servers are different in that they typically do not require the client to send a certificate, so there is usually no certificate
checking. Also, it is typically useless to perform host name checking.</p>

<H1 CLASS="SECT1">Code Samples</H1>

<p>The best samples of how to use the various SSL objects are in the tests directory, and the test_ssl.py file specifically.
There are additional samples in the demo directory, but they are not quaranteed to be up to date.</p>
	
<p>NOTE: The tests and demos
may not be secure as is. Use the information above on how to make them secure.</p>

<P>ssldump "is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyser. It identifies
    TCP connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
    them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
    decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If
    provided with the appropriate keying material, it will also decrypt the
    connections and display the application data traffic.  
    </P>
    
    <P>
    If linked with OpenSSL, ssldump can display certificates in decoded form
    and decrypt traffic (provided that it has the appropriate keying
    material)."
