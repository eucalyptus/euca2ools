This directory contains unit tests for M2Crypto.

To run all tests, make sure you have installed setuptools and then issue the
following command from the M2Crypto root directory:

python setup.py test

To run tests in a single file, for example test_ssl.py, do this:

python setup.py test --test-suite=tests.test_ssl


Look also in the demo directory for other samples.


To create new test certificates:

mkdir certs
cd certs

Making the CA. You may want to use a locally edited openssl.cnf to
make sure that X509v3 Basic Constraints CA:TRUE gets set (by default
it may be false). By default duration may only be just one year; should
set this for at least 3 years.

CA.sh -newca
cp demoCA/cacert.pem ../ca.pem

Making the server certificate and private key. make sure commonName
field is localhost.

CA.sh -newreq
CA.sh -sign
cp newcert.pem ../server.pem
openssl rsa <newkey.pem >>../server.pem

Making the x509 certificate and key.

CA.sh -newreq
CA.sh -sign
cp newcert.pem ../x509.pem
openssl rsa <newkey.pem >>../x509.pem
openssl x509 -in ../x509.pem -out ../x509.der -outform DER

Making the signer certificate. Make sure the email address is 
signer@example.com.

CA.sh -newreq
CA.sh -sign
cp newcert.pem ../signer.pem
openssl rsa <newkey.pem >../signer_key.pem

Making the recipient certificate. Make sure the email address is 
recipient@example.com.

CA.sh -newreq
CA.sh -sign
cp newcert.pem ../recipient.pem
openssl rsa <newkey.pem >../recipient_key.pem


Finally run the tests and edit for new values.
