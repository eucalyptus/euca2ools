Euca2ools 3 Installation
========================

This file describes the steps needed to install euca2ools from source.
Your operating system vendor may already offer euca2ools in packaged
form that you can install using yum, apt-get, or a similar tool.


Requirements
------------

Euca2ools currently work with python versions 2.6 and 2.7.  Work is
ongoing to port the suite to version 3.3.

You must also have the following python libraries installed.  All of
them are available on PyPi:
 - lxml (http://lxml.de/)
 - requestbuilder (https://github.com/boto/requestbuilder)
 - requests (http://www.python-requests.org/)
 - setuptools (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
 - six (http://pythonhosted.org/six/)

The bundle-related tools require several other executables as well:
 - blkid
 - dd
 - gzip or pigz
 - mkfs
 - mount
 - openssl
 - sync
 - umount

Finally, euca-get-password requires openssl.

For specific package names for these dependencies, check the
distribution-specific sections below.

Installation
------------

To install from a source tarball:

    $ tar xzf euca2ools-3.0.0.tar.gz
    $ cd euca2ools-3.0.0
    $ python setup.py install

To install directly from git:

    $ git clone git://github.com/eucalyptus/euca2ools
    $ cd euca2ools
    $ python setup.py install

The euca2ools suite also ships with a default configuration file and
certificates that you may find useful.  To use them we recommend
copying them onto your system like so:

    # mkdir /etc/euca2ools
    # cp conf/euca2ools.ini /etc/euca2ools/euca2ools.ini
    # mkdir /usr/share/euca2ools
    # cp -R certs /usr/share/euca2ools/certs
