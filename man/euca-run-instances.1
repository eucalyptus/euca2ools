.SH DESCRIPTION
Launch instances of a machine image
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
IMAGE
ID of the image to instantiate (required)
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-n\fR MIN[\-MAX], \fB\-\-instance\-count\fR MIN[\-MAX]
number of instances to launch. If this number of
instances cannot be launched, no instances will
launch. If specified as a range (min\-max), the server
will attempt to launch the maximum number, but no
fewer than the minimum number.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR GROUP, \fB\-\-group\fR GROUP
security group(s) in which to launch the instances
.TP
\fB\-k\fR KEYPAIR, \fB\-\-key\fR KEYPAIR
name of the key pair to use
.TP
\fB\-d\fR DATA, \fB\-\-user\-data\fR DATA
user data to make available to instances in this
reservation
.TP
\fB\-\-user\-data\-force\fR DATA
same as \fB\-d\fR/\-\-user\-data, but without checking if a file
by that name exists first
.TP
\fB\-f\fR FILE, \fB\-\-user\-data\-file\fR FILE
file containing user data to make available to the
instances in this reservation
.TP
\fB\-\-addressing\fR {public,private}
[Eucalyptus only] addressing scheme to launch the
instance with. Use "private" to run an instance with
no public address.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR INSTANCETYPE, \fB\-\-instance\-type\fR INSTANCETYPE
type of instance to launch
.HP
\fB\-z\fR ZONE, \fB\-\-availability\-zone\fR ZONE
.TP
\fB\-\-kernel\fR KERNEL
ID of the kernel to launch the instance(s) with
.TP
\fB\-\-ramdisk\fR RAMDISK
ID of the ramdisk to launch the instance(s) with
.TP
\fB\-b\fR DEVICE=MAPPED, \fB\-\-block\-device\-mapping\fR DEVICE=MAPPED
define a block device mapping for the instances, in
the form DEVICE=MAPPED, where "MAPPED" is "none",
"ephemeral(0\-3)", or "[SNAPID]:[GiB]:[true|false]:[standard|VOLTYPE[:IOPS]]"
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-monitor\fR
enable detailed monitoring for the instance(s)
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-api\-termination\fR
prevent API users from terminating the instance(s)
.TP
\fB\-\-instance\-initiated\-shutdown\-behavior\fR {stop,terminate}
whether to "stop" (default) or terminate EBS instances
when they shut down
.TP
\fB\-\-placement\-group\fR PLGROUP
name of a placement group to launch into
.TP
\fB\-\-tenancy\fR {default,dedicated}
[VPC only] "dedicated" to run on single\-tenant
hardware
.TP
\fB\-\-client\-token\fR TOKEN
unique identifier to ensure request idempotency
.TP
\fB\-s\fR SUBNET, \fB\-\-subnet\fR SUBNET
[VPC only] subnet to create the instance's network
interface in
.TP
\fB\-\-private\-ip\-address\fR ADDRESS
[VPC only] assign a specific primary private IP
address to an instance's interface
.TP
\fB\-\-secondary\-address\fR ADDRESS, \fB\-\-secondary\-private\-ip\-address\fR ADDRESS
[VPC only] assign a specific secondary private IP
address to an instance's network interface. Use this
option multiple times to add additional addresses.
.TP
\fB\-\-secondary\-count\fR COUNT, \fB\-\-secondary\-private\-ip\-address\-count\fR COUNT
[VPC only] automatically assign a specific number of
secondary private IP addresses to an instance's
network interface
.TP
\fB\-a\fR INTERFACE, \fB\-\-network\-interface\fR INTERFACE
[VPC only] add a network interface to the new
instance. If the interface already exists, supply its
ID and a numeric index for it, separated by ":", in
the form "eni\-NNNNNNNN:INDEX". To create a new
interface, supply a numeric index and subnet ID for
it, along with (in order) an optional description, a
primary private IP address, a list of security group
IDs to associate with the interface, whether to delete
the interface upon instance termination ("true" or
"false"), a number of secondary private IP addresses
to create automatically, and a list of secondary
private IP addresses to assign to the interface,
separated by ":", in the form ":INDEX:SUBNET:[DESCRIPT
ION]:[PRIV_IP]:[GROUP1,GROUP2,...]:[true|false]:[SEC_I
P_COUNT|:SEC_IP1,SEC_IP2,...]". You cannot specify
both of the latter two. This option may be used
multiple times. Each adds another network interface.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR IPROFILE, \fB\-\-iam\-profile\fR IPROFILE
name or ARN of the IAM instance profile to associate
with the new instance(s)
.TP
\fB\-\-ebs\-optimized\fR
optimize the new instance(s) for EBS I/O
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-empty\-fields\fR
show empty values as "(nil)"
.TP
\fB\-U\fR URL, \fB\-\-url\fR URL
compute service endpoint URL
.TP
\fB\-\-region\fR USER@REGION
region and/or user names to search when looking up
config file data
.HP
\fB\-I\fR KEY_ID, \fB\-\-access\-key\-id\fR KEY_ID
.HP
\fB\-S\fR KEY, \fB\-\-secret\-key\fR KEY
.HP
\fB\-\-security\-token\fR TOKEN
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
show debugging output
.TP
\fB\-\-debugger\fR
launch interactive debugger on error
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show the program's version and exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
