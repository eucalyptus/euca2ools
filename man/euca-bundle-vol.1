named by TMPDIR, TEMP, or TMP environment variables,
or otherwise \fI/var/tmp\fP)

size of the image to create (default: 10240 MiB)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-filter\fR
do not filter out sensitive/system files
.TP
\fB\-\-all\fR
include all filesystems regardless of type (default:
only include local filesystems)
.TP
\fB\-\-inherit\fR
use the metadata service to provide metadata for the
