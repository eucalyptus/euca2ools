Euca2ools: Command-line tools for interacting with Amazon EC2, IAM, and
           S3 API-compatible Web services using the REST/Query API.

Euca2ools are command-line tools for interacting with Web services
that export a REST/Query-based API compatible with Amazon EC2, IAM,
and S3 services.  The tools can be used with both Amazon's services
and with installations of the Eucalyptus open-source cloud-computing
infrastructure.  The tools were inspired by command-line tools distributed
by Amazon (api-tools and ami-tools) and largely accept the same options
and environment variables.  However, these tools were implemented from
scratch in Python, relying on the Boto AWS library and M2Crypto toolkit.

Here is the summary of the tasks that can be accomplished with these
tools:

- Query of availability zones (i.e. clusters in Eucalyptus)
- SSH key management (add, list, delete)
- VM control (start, list, stop, reboot)
- Security group management (firewall configuration)
- Volume and snapshot management (attach, list, detach, create, bundle,
  delete)
- Image management (bundle, upload, register, list, deregister)
- IP address management (allocate, associate, list, release)
- Console output retrieval

Please, consult the INSTALL file for instructions on installation and
running the tools.  COPYING file covers the legal matters, such as
the license.  For more information, please see:
